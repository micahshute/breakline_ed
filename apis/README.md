# APIs

API stands for Application Programming Interface. The concept is relatively general and has wide applications, but you will most often encounter the term to refer to an HTTP endpoint that delivers data, usually in JSON format.

Generally, an API is any interface between two applications. Functions, objects, and classes from an external library can be called an API. If you are writing code that will be called by other classes/programs, the functions and methods you write that are to be used by others can be described as an API.

Usually, however, APIs are usually used in the context of describing an HTTP endpoint that you can hit in order to get information from the site. Most sites will give you raw JSON (Javascript Object Notation) data which can be parsed easily by most languages in easy-to-use objects. Try going to https://www.reddit.com/.json to see an example. Something more easily digested could be this API example: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/arcanine
